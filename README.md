# Le-Chat-Clair
A fan-game of sorts based off of Le Chat Fonce by Robert Romao. This one focuses on Emma as the main character.
Not much going on here, just a simple practice game I am making in my spare time. Updates and progress will be fairly consistent, about once a month, but that is subject to variation and business levels.
    This game focuses on the character Emma from the last Le Chat Fonce game, set years in the future. She and Fonce are visiting their hometown after years of real life has passed, taking in the nostalgia as much as they can before the end of the summer. This is a heavily story-based game, and does not include much action aside from short quick-time actions or minor jumpscares. Have fun!
